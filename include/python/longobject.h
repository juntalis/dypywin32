   are filled and there's nothing special about bit 0x80 of the MSB.

   representation of v's value.  Bit 0x80 of the MSB is the sign bit.

   + is_signed is 0 and v < 0.  TypeError is set in this case, and bytes
     isn't altered.
   + n isn't big enough to hold the full mathematical value of v.  For
     example, if is_signed is 0 and there are more digits in the v than
     fit in n; or if is_signed is 1, v < 0, and n is just 1 bit shy of
     being large enough to hold a sign bit.  OverflowError is set in this
     case, but bytes holds the least-signficant n bytes of the true value.
